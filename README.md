# Signaling Games
Python implementations of variations of the Signaling Game proposed by David Lewis. 

* We focus on setups where there are more states/actions than signals and have the Sender/Receiver implement reinforcement learning with stimulus generalization.

## Setups
* Basic Setup: Sender/Receiver Stimulus Generalization

* Alternating Role Setup: Sender/Receiver Alternate Between Roles
